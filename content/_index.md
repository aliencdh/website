## Welcome to my humble little blog~

### About me:

I'm Alicia, an EU-based developer.
I prefer backend work (such as writing APIs and implementing logic/libraries),
but I can handle frontend work, including HTML-based environments.
I also have knowledge of game development (mostly retro 2D games), emulators and a bit of OS development.
