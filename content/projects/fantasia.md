> A 3D renderer I decided to write as a practice project, in Rust, with as few dependencies as possible. 

When I first thought about starting this project, I was pretty intimidated. 
I had assumed that renderers are such vastly complicated things that I couldn't possibly hope to understand them.
But I found a nice little guide about writing one in C, and I decided to follow it.
But rather than just following it in C, I decided to do it in Rust.

And that was for 2 simple reasons:
1. I didn't want to simply be able to copy-paste the parts I didn't understand. I wanted to
have to somehow try to understand what was going on before adapting it to Rust.
2. I simply like the safety of Rust, and how it makes it so that I have much fewer things to worry about
than in C.

But... The book just didn't work that well for me, no offense to the author.
It explained certain concepts in a way that I just couldn't understand, and sometimes it didn't explain them at all.
So I stumbled around trying my best to come up with my own solutions where I could, until it all started clicking for me.
Hoping to make this process easier for other people, I've decided to try and write a guide for it.
